Q:What are Modules in Node.js? 
ANS:Modules in Node.js are small, independent blocks of code that perform specific        
    tasks. They help in organizing code, making it reusable and easy to maintain. Node.js uses the CommonJS module system,               
    where you can export and import code between files using module.exports and require(). 

There are two main types of modules: 
1:Core Modules 
2:Custom Modules 

* Use of the fs Module: 
The fs module stands for File System, and it's a built-in module in Node.js. It allows you to work with the file system â€” such as creating, reading, writing, updating, or deleting files. 

* In this project: 

fs.writeFileSync() was used to write the result of math operations to a file named log.txt. 

fs.readFileSync() was used to read the contents of log.txt and display it in the terminal.
